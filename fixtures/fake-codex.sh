# A stand-in for the `codex` binary, wired through AGCTL_CODEX_BIN under the
# `testing` feature. The twin of fixtures/fake-security.sh, and it exists for
# the same reason: `agctl codex login` spawns the vendor's own CLI, and a test
# that spawned the real one would open a browser and mint a real grant against
# the developer's own ChatGPT account.
#
# It records what it was asked to do and then does exactly what the control
# variables say. Every path it writes is inside the scratch home agctl handed
# it through CODEX_HOME; it never looks at, let alone touches, a home it was
# not given.
#
# WITH NO KNOBS SET it reproduces what fact F81 measured a NORMAL, successful
# `codex login` to leave behind at alpha.12 — see "the residue" below. That is
# deliberate: the residue includes an unheld `tmp/arg0/codex-arg0<rand>/.lock`,
# and a survivor check that treated a lock file's existence as evidence would
# refuse every real login (ledger #310). The happy-path test only proves what
# it claims if the happy path leaves a real login's mess behind.
#
#   AGCTL_FAKE_CODEX_LOG        append `arg`, `cwd`, `env`, `residue` and `exit`
#                               records here
#   AGCTL_FAKE_CODEX_SLEEP      seconds to sleep before doing anything
#   AGCTL_FAKE_CODEX_EXIT       exit status (default 0)
#   AGCTL_FAKE_CODEX_AUTH       a file whose contents become <CODEX_HOME>/auth.json
#   AGCTL_FAKE_CODEX_DAEMON_DIR create <CODEX_HOME>/app-server-daemon/ as well
#   AGCTL_FAKE_CODEX_NO_RESIDUE leave no `tmp/arg0` residue at all
#   AGCTL_FAKE_CODEX_HELD_LOCK  leave the residue's `.lock` HELD by a live
#                               process, so the refusal path meets a real held
#                               lock and not a simulated one
#   AGCTL_FAKE_CODEX_KEYCHAIN_GAIN
#                               a fake `security` dump file: append one
#                               `Codex Auth` record to it, as a child that put
#                               its credential in the keychain would
#   AGCTL_FAKE_CODEX_KEYCHAIN_GAIN_ACCOUNT
#                               that record's `acct` attribute (default
#                               `cli|0123456789abcdef`), so a test can plant a
#                               spelling agctl would never have written
#   AGCTL_FAKE_CODEX_ODD_LOCK   create a DIRECTORY of this name under
#                               <CODEX_HOME>, so the survey meets an entry
#                               named `*.lock` that is not a regular file
#   AGCTL_FAKE_CODEX_TOUCH      create this file (a marker another fake reads)
#   AGCTL_FAKE_CODEX_SENTINEL   a directory OUTSIDE the scratch: link it from
#                               inside the residue, so a cleanup that followed
#                               a link would reach it. A knob, not default
#                               residue: F81 measured links to FILES
#

# There is deliberately no knob that swaps `auth.json` after this process
# exits. That used to exist and never fired inside its window (a 0.2 s timer
# against an agctl that had already removed the scratch). The AC126 test now
# does the swap itself, while agctl waits at a `testing` pause point.
#
# THE ENVIRONMENT RECORD IS NAMES ONLY, except for the three variables whose
# values the assertions need (CODEX_HOME, HOME, TMPDIR). A fixture that dumped
# every value would be a fixture that writes secrets to a file the moment
# somebody runs it with a real environment.

# The modes fact F81 measured a real login to leave: `drwx------` and
# `-rw-------`. Set before anything is created.
